# Quizzler-application

This repository contains a Python-based Quiz App built using Object-Oriented Programming principles. The app leverages a clean architecture with the following components:
-Question Class: Represents individual questions with their text and correct answer.
-QuizBrain Class: Handles the core logic of the quiz, including managing the question bank, tracking the score, and determining quiz progress.
-QuizInterface Class: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the quiz using Tkinter, making the app interactive and user-friendly.
-question_data Module: Supplies a list of question dictionaries, each containing a question and its correct answer.

Users can answer trivia questions in a fun and interactive way, with real-time feedback and a final score summary. The code is modular, extendable, and beginner-friendly.
